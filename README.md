# factorial-python
Defining a recursive function called factorial that calculates the factorial of a given number n. The base case is when n is equal to 0, in which case we return 1. Otherwise, we recursively call factorial with n - 1 and multiply it by n. Finally, we test the function by calculating the factorial of the number 5 and printing the result.
